# Terms of Service

By using the Hybrid Dancers website or booking a class, you agree to these terms.

## Bookings
Class spots are reserved on a first come, first served basis. If you need to cancel, please let us know 24 hours before the class starts.

## Payments
All payments are processed through Stripe. We never store your card information. Class fees are non-refundable once the session begins.

## Conduct
Please be respectful toward instructors and fellow students. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone who disrupts a class.

## Updates
These terms may change as our studio grows. Continued use of the site means you accept any revised terms.
