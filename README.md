# Hybrid Dancers

This repository contains the public site for Hybrid Dancers.

## Git Setup

To set up the repository locally, run the provided setup script:

```bash
./git-init.sh
```

The script initializes Git and pushes the initial commit to GitHub. Make sure it is executable before running.

## Booking Flow

Clicking any `Book` button on the site will now open `booking.html` where visitors can submit their name, email and desired class. Submitting the form launches a pre-filled email so bookings can be handled manually.

## Site Analyzer

Run `./site_analyzer.py` to inspect the HTML files for missing links and confirm that booking functionality is available.
