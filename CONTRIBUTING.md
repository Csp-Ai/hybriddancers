# Contributing to Hybrid Dancers

Thank you for helping improve the Hybrid Dancers website! This project mixes a small Node.js server with static HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Automated tests live in the `tests/` folder and run with **pytest**.

## Project Setup

1. Install Node dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Install Python test dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the values for your local environment.

## Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes and add tests when appropriate.
3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
4. Commit using a clear message in the present tense.
5. Open a pull request targeting `main`.

## Code Standards

- JavaScript and HTML use **2 spaces** for indentation.
- Keep functions small and well commented.
- Use environment variables for secrets; never hardâ€‘code API keys.
- Ensure `pytest` passes before submitting.

We appreciate all issues and pull requests. Happy coding!
